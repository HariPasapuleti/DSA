# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

1. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a classic algorithm used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. 
2. It can handle graphs with positive or negative edge weights but `does not work with negative weight cycles.`

## Algorithm Overview

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm works by iteratively improving the estimates of the shortest paths between each pair of vertices. It uses a dynamic programming approach to consider each vertex as an intermediate point in the path between every pair of vertices.

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a distance matrix `D` where `D[i][j]` represents the shortest distance from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.
   - Initialize `D[i][j]` to the weight of the edge between `i` and `j` if there is an edge; otherwise, initialize it to infinity (`∞`), except for `D[i][i]`, which should be 0 (the distance from a vertex to itself).

2. **Dynamic Programming Iteration:**
   - Iterate through each vertex `k` in the graph.
   - For each pair of vertices `(i, j)`, update `D[i][j]` to be the minimum of `D[i][j]` and `D[i][k] + D[k][j]`.

3. **Result:**
   - After completing the iterations, `D[i][j]` contains the shortest distance from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.

### Pseudocode

```text
function FloydWarshall(graph):
    // graph is represented as an adjacency matrix
    n = number of vertices in graph
    D = adjacency matrix of graph
    
    // Initialize the distance matrix
    for each vertex i in graph:
        for each vertex j in graph:
            if i != j and there is no edge between i and j:
                D[i][j] = ∞
            else if i == j:
                D[i][j] = 0
    
    // Main Floyd-Warshall algorithm
    for each vertex k in graph:
        for each vertex i in graph:
            for each vertex j in graph:
                if D[i][j] > D[i][k] + D[k][j]:
                    D[i][j] = D[i][k] + D[k][j]
    
    return D
```

# If there is negative cycle we put a condition like. 
    ```bash
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if(matrix[i][i] < 0) return somthing;
    }
    ```


# Complexity
1. Time Complexity: O(n^3), where n is the number of vertices. This is due to the three nested loops in the algorithm.
2. Space Complexity: O(n^2), due to the storage of the distance matrix.

# Real World Applications of Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:
1. In computer networking, the algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a network. This is termed as network routing.
2. Flight Connectivity In the aviation industry to find the shortest path between the airports.
3. GIS(Geographic Information Systems) applications often involve analyzing spatial data, such as road networks, to find the shortest paths between locations.
4. Kleene’s algorithm which is a generalization of floyd warshall, can be used to find regular expression for a regular language.
